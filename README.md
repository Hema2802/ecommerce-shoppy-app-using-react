 * Utilized React for component-based architecture, Redux for
 state management, and React Router for client-side routing.

 useEffect, with error handling and performance optimizations
 using lazy loading.
 * Implemented reusable components with props and ensured
 responsive UI across devices.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
